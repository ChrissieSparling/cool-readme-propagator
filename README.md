## Description 
It will take in all Doctor's notes and return the top results from all symptoms inputted. No need for second oppinions. It gives you the top answers you need without doing the research. It protects the doctor by limiting their "opinion" based on whether they believe you have those symptoms or not. forcing them to listen, while at the same time protecting both parties. I want to eventually have a system in place that could be sold to the government to help reduce the overcost of medical expenses and giving patients confidence in doctors again, while protecting the doctors from "suits" for being to stuck on one thing and not looking at all the facts. They are protected.
